# Montagix SDK Sample React Project

This project serves as a playground for exploring and interacting with the Montagix SDK. It showcases some basic interactions and provides a hands-on way to discover the capabilities of the SDK.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Obtain an Access Key

Before setting up the project, you'll need to obtain an access key for the SDK. Check out [our website](https://docs.montagix.com/getting-started) to learn how to get one.

### 2. Configure npm

Once you have your access key, create a .npmrc file in the root of the project (if it doesn't exist already), and add the following line, replacing your-access-key with the access key you received:

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=your-access-key
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

With the .npmrc file configured, install the project dependencies using either npm or Yarn:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
